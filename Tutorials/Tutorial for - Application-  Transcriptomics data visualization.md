# Tutorial for : Transcriptomics data visualization 

This is a tool for transcriptomics data analysis

It performs:

(1) Analysis of genetic expression to differentiallly expressed genes

(2) define genetic expression of genes as : Not differentially expressed, Up regulated, or Down regulated

(3) Performs Genetic Ontology enrichment analysis

(4) Visualize GO data as barplot

### Usage Guide

### Step 1

The app is accessible on the oSPARc Platform at : osparc.io

You should search for the service with the name "Transcriptomics data visualization ", as in figure bellow:

### Step 2

Next you need to click on the "open" button

The user interface ( Figure bellow) includes 3 parts:
- Description of the tool
- Sidebar to import input data
- Main Panel to display outputs

### Step 3

This app requires as inputs transcriptomics data as csv file to be uploaded using the upload button.

For first time user a demo option is available, You need to select the demo option then click on submit.

To import your own data select the "Import CSV File option and click submit

### Outputs

The output include expression profile analysis and visualization in a volcano plot.

Additionally an ontology analysis will be performed and the results will be illustrated as barplot.
